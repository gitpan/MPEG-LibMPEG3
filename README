MPEG::LibMPEG3 version 0.01
===========================

MPEG::LibMPEG3 provides a Perl interface to the LibMPEG3 C library.  
Using this module, you may extract information and YUV video frames 
an MPEG stream.  Extracting audio is still under construction through
patches are welcome.

This module decodes:

	MPEG-1 Layer II Audio
	MPEG-1 Layer III Audio
	MPEG-2 Layer III Audio
	MPEG-1 program streams
	MPEG-2 program streams
	MPEG-2 transport streams
	AC3 Audio
	MPEG-2 Video
	MPEG-1 Video
	IFO files
	VOB files

Testing has only been performed under Linux 2.4.x and the i386
architechture.  I have, however, tried to make the configuration 
cross-platform by using Config.pm and would like to know if you 
have success on another platform (particularly big-endian).  

The Makefile.PL expects gcc to be in the current path.  For this
reason, I don't expect this module to build correctly under Windows.  
Maybe it will work if cygwin is installed?

INSTALLATION

Note that you will need to copy the libmpeg3.so and header files to
your lib and include directories.  I do something like:

  cd libmpeg3/
  find -iname "*.h" -exec cp {} /usr/local/include
  cp ARCH/libmpeg3.so /usr/local/lib
  /sbin/ldconfig

To then install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
